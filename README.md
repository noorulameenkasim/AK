# Womigo

Prototype skeleton for the Womigo application, a platform inspired by Swiggy to empower women entrepreneurs selling local food products.

## Structure

- `backend/` – Node.js Express server with a single placeholder endpoint.
- `frontend/` – React app powered by Vite with a minimal page.

## Getting Started

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Both sides include a simple `npm test` placeholder command.
